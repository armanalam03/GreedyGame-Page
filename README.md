This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
 ## Getting Started 
 First, run the development server: ```npm run dev```  or ``` yarn run dev ```. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 
 You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. ## Learn More To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources: - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
